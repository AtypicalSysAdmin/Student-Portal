# Student-Portal
C# Windows form app (file database)

You will find database file in 

"Where you extracted or downloaded the project"\Student Portal\Student Portal\bin\Debug\database

You can change storing file address however you want even you can change it to SQL or SQLite, but before that make sure you won't mix them up.

If you want to change it to SQL, just follow the structure for your files paths to create rows and columns

I posted whole project in zip so that you can download, extract, and run it easily.

Feel free to ask anything about how this works
