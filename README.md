# Student-Portal
C# Windows form app (file database)

I know, I know, I was student back then, two weeks to final exam to develope a fullstack application by myself in compete to others with group of 4

So couldn't get time to build a proper folder structure for the modules

--File Database path - probably stores in csv format, been back after long time to this repo to fix its bloody readme

.\Student Portal\Student Portal\bin\Debug\database
